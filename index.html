          Many premium cards bundle “memberships” – lounge access, partner clubs, subscriptions, status shortcuts and discount programs.
          This guide explains what those memberships really are, how they’re funded, and when the perks are worth the fee.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Is a Membership-Focused Card?</h2>
      <p>
        A membership-focused credit card is one where a large part of the value comes from bundled memberships or
        access programs, rather than from raw earn rates on points or cashback. Instead of only earning rewards,
        you gain access to lounges, partner clubs, fast-track status levels, subscription rebates or curated discount platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the issuer’s perspective, these memberships are usually negotiated in bulk with partners. The card’s annual fee
        helps cover those costs. For you as a cardholder, the key question is whether you will actually use the memberships
        enough to justify that fee year after year.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Types of perks -->
    <section id="perks" class="section">
      <h2>Typical Membership Perks Bundled with Cards</h2>
      <p>
        Membership-style benefits can cover a wide range of services. Not every card has all of them, but most premium
        products combine several:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Airport lounge memberships:</strong> Access to independent lounge networks, airline lounges or
          limited-visit passes when travelling.</li>
        <li><strong>Hotel or airline status shortcuts:</strong> Credits towards elite tiers, automatic mid-tier status, or
          “spend X, get Y status” offers.</li>
        <li><strong>Subscription rebates:</strong> Refunds or statement credits for streaming, delivery or productivity services
          when you pay with the card.</li>
        <li><strong>Shopping &amp; dining clubs:</strong> Access to closed discount platforms, priority reservations or private sales.</li>
        <li><strong>Concierge &amp; experiences:</strong> Curated events, presale ticket access and booking assistance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These memberships can be powerful if they match your lifestyle – but nearly useless if you rarely travel, don’t stay in
        chain hotels or mainly use local services outside the partner list.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Value & trade-offs -->
    <section id="value" class="section">
      <h2>How to Evaluate Membership Value</h2>
      <p>
        To judge whether a membership-style card is worth it, you need to estimate the realistic value of the perks <em>you</em> will use –
        not the theoretical “up to” numbers from marketing.
      </p>
      <p>Key questions to ask yourself:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How many trips per year will I take where lounge access actually matters?</li>
        <li>Do I prefer the partner airlines, hotels and restaurants listed, or do I mostly use other brands?</li>
        <li>Would I pay for these memberships out of pocket if they weren’t bundled with the card?</li>
        <li>Are there blackout dates, guest fees, visit caps or credit expiries that reduce the practical value?</li>
        <li>Does the card’s annual fee still make sense if I only use 50–60% of the advertised perks?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A card can have impressive membership perks on paper, but if your travel and consumption patterns don’t align with them,
        a simpler lower-fee product might be better.
