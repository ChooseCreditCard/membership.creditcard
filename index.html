        Many cards offer “membership” — a bundle of status levels, upgrade paths, perks and partner benefits. This page explains how memberships are structured, which perks matter, and how to compare programs across different issuers.

  <!-- Overview -->
  <section id="overview" class="section">
    <h2>What Is a Credit-Card Membership?</h2>
    <p>Membership programs bundle cardholder benefits into tiers. These tiers may include travel perks, concierge access, insurance upgrades, partner discounts or annual credits. Unlike basic card features, membership benefits are structured around ongoing loyalty and status, not only card usage.</p>
    <p>Some cards automatically grant membership upon approval, while others require meeting annual spend thresholds or maintaining account activity to unlock higher-tier status.</p>
  </section>

  <!-- Mechanics -->
  <section id="mechanics" class="section">
    <h2>How Membership Tiers, Upgrades & Perks Work</h2>
    <p>Most membership systems include one or more status levels — for example: base, mid-tier and premium. Each level unlocks additional benefits such as travel credits, lounge access, partner upgrades or exclusive offers.</p>
    <p>Upgrades may be triggered by yearly spending, reward-point milestones or issuer-specific qualification rules. Some issuers also offer “soft landings” where you keep part of your perks even if you do not re-qualify every year.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Membership Value: What Actually Matters</h2>
    <p>Membership perks vary widely. Some programs offer valuable travel-oriented benefits like hotel status or lounge passes, while others focus on merchant discounts or dining credits. The real value depends on whether you use the included perks consistently, not just the headline tier label.</p>
    <p>Cardholders should evaluate whether the total membership value outweighs the annual fee or spending commitment required to maintain their tier.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Limitations, Fees & Eligibility Rules</h2>
    <p>Certain perks may have usage caps, blackout dates or geographic restrictions. Premium tiers may require high annual fees or minimum spending volumes. Partner benefits can also change as contracts renew, meaning perks are not guaranteed year-to-year.</p>
    <p>Some membership programs restrict eligibility based on residence, issuer policies or network rules, especially when partner perks involve travel or luxury services.</p>
